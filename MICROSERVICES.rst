Microservices
-------------

Microservices are container-based applications hosted inside a Docker container. 

Microservices provide additional behind-the-scenes functions, such as services and data-processing, within experiences. However, microservices rarely have their own UI. Instead, they add UI functionality to widgets through the use of component-sets. 

Microservices cannot be used to create an experience without the addition of a widget. Instead, they assist widgets by adding additional logic and/or data access to an experience. 

Microservices should be used when an application:
 * Delivers access to an external API
 * Provides authentication or authorization to a widget
 * Uses or provides access to a database 
 * Provides a service (For example: emailing listed individuals, running calculations, or creating a pdf document)

.. warning::
   All microservices that make platform level calls must send their URI signed. Lumavate provides signing libraries for Go, Python, and #C. All other containers will be unable to send signed URIs. :ref:`Vist the sample code section for a link to each of these signed libraries <Code Samples>`.

.. _Accepted File Types M:

Accepted File Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Microservices need to be either a **gzip** or **tar** file in order to be upload to the Lumavate platform. 

 For more information about uploading tools to the platform, consult :ref:`Uploading A Tool`. 
 
 There is no required file names or structure. A microservice is only required to define two endpoints: Discover and Render.

.. _API Endpoints M:

Implementing API Endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Any microservice developed for Lumavate must implement two key API endpoints, **Discover** and **Render**.
 
 All endpoints will contain two dynamic parts and a route: 
 
  * The first part corresponds to the type of microservice uploaded denoted as ``service_type``. 
 
  * The second part corresponds to the logical location of the microservice denoted as ``integration_cloud``. 

    .. code-block:: python
   
       /<string:integration_cloud>/<string:service_type>/<route>

  Some endpoints may also contain the specific instance of the microservice denoted as ``instance_id``.
   
    .. code-block:: python
   
       /<string:integration_cloud>/<string:service_type>/instances/<int:instance_id>/<route>

Required Endpoints
++++++++++++++++++

 All microservices require the following API endpoints:

 #. DISCOVER

    This endpoint informs the platform via JSON which :ref:`properties <properties>` exist for the microservice. The platform automatically adds a few platform level properties outside of this endpoint. An empty set should be sent if the microservice does not require any properties.
    
     .. code-block:: python

        /<string:integration_cloud>/<string:service_type>/discover/properties

    Properties need to be written in the following format:

     .. code-block::  rest

        METHOD: GET
        CONTENT-TYPE: application/json
        RESPONSE:
          {
            "payload": {
              "data": [
                {
                  "classification": "General",
                  "default": false,
                  "helpText": "",
                  "label": "Display Background Image",
                  "name": "displayBackgroundImage",
                  "section": "Settings",
                  "type": "toggle"
                },
                {
                  "classification": "General",
                  "helpText": "",
                  "label": "Background Image",
                  "name": "backgroundImage",
                  "section": "Settings",
                  "type": "image-upload"
                }
              ]
            }
          }

    .. tip::
       Lumavate provides property libraries for Go, Python, and C# that allow properties to be written in alternate formats that better match those languages normal style. For the property libraries as well as example containers that use them, :ref:`please consult the sample code section<Code Samples>`.
 
 #. RENDER

    This endpoint is called when the microservice renders itself for preview. If the microservice does not have a UI, a default image should be sent.
    
    .. code-block:: python

       /<string:integration_cloud>/<string:service_type>

Optional Endpoints
++++++++++++++++++

 * ON_CREATE_VERSION

   This endpoint is called **before** the properties are saved within the Lumavate studio. This allows the developer to modify and/or override any property data before saving.

   .. code-block:: python

      /<string:integration_cloud>/<string:service_type>/instances/<int:instance_id>/on-create-version


 * AFTER_CREATE_VERSION

   This endpoint is called **after** the properties are saved within the Lumavate studio. This allows the developer to adjust any property data after saving.

   .. code-block:: python

      /<string:integration_cloud>/<string:service_type>/instances/<int:instance_id>/after-create-version
