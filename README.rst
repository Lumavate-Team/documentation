Lumavate Tools
==============

Tools are used to build Experiences within Lumavate.  Each Tool can be versioned when registered with the Platform, ensuring that current production
Experiences cannot be ill-affected during the development and/or testing of updated code.

Widgets
-------

Widgets are reusable container-based web applications that can consist of one to many pages. It is a reusable web application that can be utilized across multiple Lumavate Experiences. For example, a “Locator” is a standard Widget. It provides location services and can be used in multiple Experiences.

Microservices

Similar to Widgets, Microservices are container-based applications used within the Experiences. A Microservice is intended to be a behind-the-scenes addition to an Experience, providing additional business logic and/or data access to an Experience.

Component Sets
--------------

A Component Set is a group of custom Web Components that can be used within Experiences, similar to Widgets. Web Components are based on existing web standards & is an industry standard with the intent to bring component-based engineering to the World Wide Web.
