Overview
========

Lumavate is a delivery platform for cloud-based web applications. Lumavate's platform allows :ref: 'studio' users to create fully compliant 'Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) <https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/>' using a WYSISYG designer based on a variety of reusable tools. These Lumavate PWAs are refered to as :ref: 'experiences'. 

To help people get the most out of our platform, Lumavate provides a set of common tools as a standard feature of the platform. These tools can be broken up into three differnet types: :ref: 'widgets', :ref: 'microservices', & :ref: 'component-sets'. However, Lumavate goes a step further enabling developers to develop their own tools that can be managed and made available in the Lumavate platform, so :ref: 'studio' users can build :ref: 'experiences' using the tools specific functionality. All three types of tools can be created by external developers for use in the Lumavate platform.

The following guide will:
* Explain how to devlope tools (:ref: 'Developing tools')
* Provide a run-down of Lumavate's tools (:ref: 'Lumavate tools')
* Walk-through the Lumavate platform (:ref: 'The platform')
* Detail the Lumavate Command Line Interface (:ref: 'CLI')
* Provide additional resources for devloping and creating with the Lumavate platform (:ref: 'Resources')
