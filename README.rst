Overview
========

 Lumavate is a delivery platform for cloud-based web applications. Its platform allows :ref:`studio <studio>` users to create fully compliant `Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) <https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/>`_ using a WYSISYG designer based on a variety of reusable tools. These Lumavate PWAs are referred to as :ref:`experiences <experiences>` throughout this guild.  
 	
 Lumavate provides a set of common tools as a standard feature of the platform to help users get the most out of our platform. These tools can be broken up into three different types: :ref:`widgets <widgets>`, :ref:`microservices <microservices>`, & :ref:`component-sets <component-sets>`. 

 However, Lumavate goes a step further, enabling developers to develop their own tools that can be managed and made available in the Lumavate platform. These tools can then be used by :ref:`studio <studio>` users to build :ref:`experiences <experiences>` using the toolâ€™s specific functionality. All three types of tools can be created by external developers for use in the Lumavate platform. For more information on the types of tools and their development, go to :ref:`Developing tools`. 

The following guide will:

* Explain how to develop tools: :ref:`Developing tools`
* Provide a run-down of Lumavate's standard tools: :ref:`Lumavate tools`
* Walk-through the Lumavate platform: :ref:`platform`
* Detail the Lumavate Command Line Interface: :ref:`CLI`
* Provide additional resources for developing and creating with the Lumavate platform: :ref:`Resources`
