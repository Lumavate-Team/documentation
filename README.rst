CLI
========

The Lumavate Commandline Interface (CLI) can be used to streamline many administrative tasks, such as adding & updating widgets, microservices, and/or
component sets.

Behind the scenes, the CLI uses the native REST APIs available via the Platform.
The CLI is also available via open-source here.
