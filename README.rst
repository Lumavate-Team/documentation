Enhance your application delivery using the Lumavate Platform!
Lumavate is a delivery platform for cloud-based web applications. All applications, also known as experiences in the platform,
are published as fully compliant Progressive Web Applications.
Lumavate allows studio users to publish web-based applications using a WYSISYG designer based on reusable web components, microservices, & widgets developed by both Lumavate and external developers.

The following topics can be used as a guide to start using your current code within Lumavate.

Lumavate, Experiences are created by studio users using a set of reusable Tools that provide discrete web functionality.

Lumavate provides a set of common tools as a standard feature of the platform. However, as a platform, Lumavate enables developers to develop their own tools that can be managed and made available in the Lumavate Studio so studio users can build Experiences using your own specific functionality.

A Tool consists of four primary things:

1. The Docker container that provides the operating environment needed to fully execute and render the tool
2. A standard set of REST APIs, for widgets & microservices, that simplifies common tasks and provides key capabilities to efficiently integrate the tool into the broader Lumavate platform
3. A list of properties studio users can set to adapt the tool functionality to their specific Experience
4. The code that implements the specific logic & capability (back-end processing, web page(s) rendering, etc.)
