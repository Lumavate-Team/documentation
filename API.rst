API Documentation
-----------------

The API documentation explains calls one can make in order to learn more about their tool, interact with Lumavate tools through the API, or get a few platform-specific items such as single-use tokens. Lumavate provides routes for sessions, widgets, component-sets, microservices, databases, domains, and tokens. The API documentation also contains an overview of how to authenticate requests, sign requests, and filter, sort, or page through returned results. 

The :ref:`widget<API Endpoints W>` and :ref:`microservice<API Endpoints M>` documentation covers tool API calls.
