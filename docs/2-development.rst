.. _Developing tools:

Developing Tools
================

  There are three types of :ref:`tools <tools>` that the Lumavate platform uses: :ref:`widgets <widgets>`, :ref:`microservice <microservices>`, and :ref:`component-sets <component-sets>`. 

  :ref:`Widgets` are the base that the other :ref:`tools <tools>` add on to and build off of. This tool should always allow :ref:`studio <studio>` users to customize part of the end user UI an functionality. 

  :ref:`Microservices` are the data-driven portion of :ref:`experiences <experiences>`. This :ref:`tool <tools>` takes information that the :ref:`studio <studio>` user provides to create a recurring service or data-set that the rest of the tools can use. Microservices almost never have their own end user UI, instead they add specific functionality to a :ref:`widget <widgets>`.

  :ref:`Component-sets` are elements that are used by :ref:`widgets <widgets>` or :ref:`microservices <microservices>`. This :ref:`tool <tools>` has two primary functions. They allow :ref:`studio <studio>` users to redistribute information collected in one widget or microservice to another. They also provide identical functionality across multiple widgets or microservices. Component-sets will never have their own UI, but they frequently add UI elements to compatible widgets and microservices.  

All Tools consist of four primary parts:

1. The :ref:`Docker container <Setting-up Docker>` that provides the operating environment needed to fully execute and render the tool.
2. A standard set of REST APIs for :ref:`widgets <API Endpoints W>` and :ref:`microservices <API Endpoints M>` as well as a metadata file for :ref:`component-sets <metadata>` that simplifies common tasks and provides key capabilities to efficiently integrate the tool into the broader Lumavate platform.
3. A list of :ref:`properties <properties>` studio users can set to adopt the tool functionality to their specific experience
4. The :ref:`code` that implements the tool's specific logic & capability (back-end processing, web page(s) rendering, etc.)

.. _Setting-up Docker:

Setting-up Docker
-----------------

  To build a :ref:`tool <tools>`, a dedicated Docker container for the tool needs to be uploaded & registered with the Lumavate platform. The platform provides pre-built Docker containers for a starting point as part of our total solution. However, a developer can use any preferred web development technology stack. The developer will need to build his/her own Docker container if the preferred stack is not listed as a pre-built Docker template.

We currently provide the following Docker container types as a template:

  * Python / Flask / Angular 2 / Nginx / GUnicorn
  * C# / .NET
  * Go

In the following sections, we will explain how to:

* Install :ref:`Docker locally <Installing Locally>`
* Setup the Lumavate :ref:`prebuilt containers <Setup Lumavate Containers>`
* Create your :ref:`own web-devlopment stack <Setup Custom Docker Containers>` 
* :ref:`Upload your web-devlopment stack <Uploading Docker>` to Lumavate

.. _Installing Locally:

Installing Locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker must be installed on your development machine in order to upload to lumavate the :ref:`tool <tools>` you are creating. Docker must be added to your local envrioment for you to acces the :ref:`Lumavate Test Harness <thor>`.

To set-up Docker on your local machine, download at least the Community Edition of Docker. The community edition is free and can be downloaded from the `Docker site: <https://www.docker.com/community-edition>`_.

Instructions on how to install Docker are avalible through `the Docker help documentation <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`_.

Docker provides troubleshooting information for both `Windows <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/>`_ and `Mac <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/troubleshoot/>`_ if you encounter issues with your download.

.. note::
  Lumavate relies heavily on Docker for its tool develpoment. Many of the commands, options, and syntax that are required when devloping   a tool will come from Docker. Therfore, we recommend that you learn more about Docker and how it works at: https://docs.docker.com.

.. _Setup Lumavate Containers:

Setup Lumavate Prebuilt Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lumavate provides three base containers to help devlopers start devloping tools for the Lumavate platform. The following explanation uses Go. For the full Go container, please see the `Go Github repository <https://github.com/Lumavate-Team/widget-base-go>`_. Additional sample containers are provided for :ref:`Python <python sample>` and :ref:`C# <C# sample>`.

Build the container
+++++++++++++++++++

#. Clone the `Lumavate sample repo <https://github.com/Lumavate-Team/widget-base-go>`_. 

#. Run the following command from the root directory of the repo.
 
   .. code-block:: go
 
 	docker build --no-cache --rm -t gobasewidget:1.0 .

   The ``--no-cache`` command specifies that cache will not be used when building containers. The ``--rm`` command removes intermediate containers after a successful builld.

#. An image will be built with the sample Docker file. 

.. note::
 	Additional Docker build options are avaliable at: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/

Run the container
+++++++++++++++++

A container must finish building before it can be run. 

#. To start the container, run the following command.
 
   .. code-block:: go
 	
	docker run -d -p 5000:8080 --volume "$(pwd)"/widget:/go/src/widget gobasewidget:1.0

   The ``-d`` option puts the container in detached mode. while, the ``-p 5000:8080`` command maps port 5000 on the machine to port 8080 on the container. Finally, the widget directory is maped to /go/src/widget directory inside the container through the ``--volume "$(pwd)"/widget:/go/src/widget`` command. 
 
   Mapping to the widget directory allows the developer to modify files in his/her local widget directory, and it will reload the process when the files change. 

#. The container will now be running in detached mode. A sample of the tool will be running on http://localhost:5000.

.. note::
	Additional Docker run options can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/

Check the logs
++++++++++++++

#. Run the following command to collect container info.

   .. code-block:: go
 
 	docker ps

#. The command will return a list of containers, shown below. Collect the Container ID or Name for the tool whose logs you wish to stream.

   .. code-block:: go
 
 	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                       NAMES
	676f62d88565        gobasemac4:dev021418   "/bin/sh -c 'bee run'"   15 minutes ago      Up 16 minutes       0.0.0.0:5000->8080/tcp       dreamy_albattani

#. Using the Container ID or Name, run the command:

   .. code-block:: go
 
 	docker logs -f 676f62d88565

#. The selected container's logs will now be streaming directly to your terminal.

.. _Setup Custom Docker Containers:

Setup Custom Docker Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section will explain how to setup custom stacks and containers to work with the Lumavate platform. It will not explain what stacks are, how to create one, or how they relate to containers. Stack and container information can be found in the `Docker help documentation <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part5/>`_. 

Coming Soon!

.. _Uploading Docker:

Uploading Docker Containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker containers can be uploaded to the Lumavate platform in two different ways, through the platform and through the CLI. This section will explain how to manually upload containers using the Lumavate platform. The CLI documentation explains how to :ref:`upload containers using the CLI <CLI Syntax>`.

.. note::
	The developer must be a user in the command center in order to upload containers through the platform. Developers only need a CLI profile in order to upload containers through the CLI.

Uploading A Tool
++++++++++++++++

#. Login to the platform and select the command center where you want to upload the container.

	   :alt: Image of the Lumavate tool Library page with the + button in the bottom right corner highlighted
	   
	   The tool Library pages have an add container button in the bottom right corner.

      b. A pop-up will appear asking for the tool container name, URL ref, and icon. Fill out all the fields, and click the Save button.

        .. figure:: ../images/addcontainerpopup.PNG
	   :align: center
	   :width: 600px
	   :alt: Image of the Lumavate Add Container pop-up
	   
	   The Add Container pop-up requires a name, URL ref, and an icon be added for each container.
        
        The required fields are:
	  * Name: what the container will be called in the platform.
	  * URL ref: what the tool will be called in the experience URL.
	  * Icon: the image shown alongside the tool in the platform.

   * To edit an existing container, click on the info card for the container you wish to edit. 
      
      .. figure:: ../images/toolpagewithcontainercardhighlighted.PNG

	 The Container Info Card displays the containerâ€™s name, icon, publisher, highest version number, highest version label, number of experiences using the container, total running versions, and last modified date.

      .. warning::
		Developers are unable to add or edit versions in containers that other command centers have shared with them.

#. You will be taken into the Container Info page for the container you just created or selected. Click the blue + button in the bottom right corner of the page to add a new version of your tool.

   .. figure:: ../images/containerinfopagewithhighlightedaddbutton.PNG
      :align: center
      :width: 500px
      :alt: Image of the Lumavate Container Info page with the add button in the bottom right corner highlighted
      
      The Container Info page has an add version button in the bottom right corner. The page shows the containerâ€™s basic information, share status, and version information.

#. You will be redirected to an Add Version page. You will have the option to add a new version from scratch or to use an existing version as a template. 

   .. figure:: ../images/addversionpage.PNG
      :align: center
      :width: 500px
      :alt: Image of the Lumavate Add Version page
      
      ..
   
   The Add Version page is split into four sections:
     * Section one allows users to use a previous version as a template
     * Section two asks for basic version information
     * Section three allows users to add additional variables
     * Section four asks users to upload their version image
    
   * To make a version from scratch:
   
      a. Go to the second section of fields in the Version Add form. Fill out the port, version number, and label field.
      
         .. figure:: ../images/versioninfofields.PNG
	    :align: center
	    :width: 400px
	    :alt: Image of the version info fields
	   
	    The version info fields are in the second section of the Add Version page. They ask for the port, version number, and label for the new version.

         The required fields are:
           * Port: which is the :ref:`port <port number>` number for the  programing language used in the image
	   * Version number: which is the version's major, minor, and patch 
	   * Label: which lables the verison in development (dev), ready for production (prod), or deprecated (old)

      b. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the upload button to upload your new Docker container image.
      
         .. figure:: ../images/imageuploadfield.PNG
	    :align: center

	    :alt: Image of the upload image field
	   
	    The upload image field is the fourth section located at the bottom of the Add Version page. 	

         .. warning::
		Different tools accept different file types. Check that the correct file type for the tool being created is used, if you are experiencing problems finding the image file. For more information on accepted file types, please visit the :ref:`widget <widget port>`, :ref:`microservice <microservice port>`, or :ref:`component-set <component-set port>` page. 

   * To use an existing version:
      
      a. Go to the first section, at the top of the Add Version form, and open the version template drop-down. Select the version you wish to use as your base. 
      
         .. figure:: ../images/versionfield.PNG
	    :align: center
	    :width: 450px
	    :alt: Image of the version template field
	   
	    The version template field is the first section of the Add Version page. The page will automatically update when a version is selected from the drop-down clearing any previously filled-out fields.

      b. All fields other than the Version Number field should have updated with the previous versionâ€™s information. Fill out the Version Number field with the new version number. 

         .. note::
		Component-sets will also need a new image uploaded as the previous versionâ€™s image will not carry over. 

#. Fill-out any additional fields that your tool requires. 
   
   * To add environment variables:
   
     .. figure:: ../images/envfield.PNG
