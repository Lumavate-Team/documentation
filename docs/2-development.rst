Developing Tools
================

Starting with Docker
--------------------

To build a tool, the dedicated Docker container for the tool is uploaded & registered with the Lumavate Platform. As part of the total solution, the platform provides pre-built Docker containers as a starting point.

We currently provide the following Docker container types as a template:

* Python / Flask / Angular 2 / Nginx / GUnicorn
* C# / .NET
* Go

A developer can use any preferred web development technology stack n the Docker conainer. A developer can build his/her own Docker container if the preferred stack is not listed as a pre-built Docker template. 

Installing Locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker must be installed on your development machine to use the Lumavate Test Harness.

The Community Edition of Docker is sufficent for Lumavate Development: https://www.docker.com/community-edition

You can also learn more about Docker at https://docs.docker.com
